# bingproxy

It is a Python implmentation of Dynamic Proxy, which is very similar with Java Dynamic Proxy.

Use "pip install bingproxy" to get the module.

If you use mirrors in China, please make sure you can get the module. It was just uploaded to pypi.org.

Please check the sample code from git to see how it works.
